	<h3>Exchange student </h3>
	<p>Autumn of 2013 I was studying in Hangzhou, China. I loved being able to communicate in such a foreign language and China truly is beautiful. My travels in China explains the header of this website, it truly is a place worth visiting if you want to take beautiful pictures! I would like to work in a place like Shanghai for a while in the future, that city was amazing. </p>
