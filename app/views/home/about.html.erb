	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>I created this website for me to showcase some projects I participated in, led or worked on by my own. I also want to share my work experience and positions of trust for you to get an idea of the dedication I have to my work. All photos on this site are captured by me.</p>

	<h3>Technical specifications </h3>
	<p>I made the website responsive using the Bootstrap framework, this makes it as good looking and as easy to navigate on a mobile device as it is on a web browser. While developing this website I have used Ruby on Rails that is a tool in my opinion perfect for web development. Twitter Bootstrap is used for visual effects and looks, Heroku is used for deployment.</p>
