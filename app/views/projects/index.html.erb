	<h3>The selfie app for android</h3>
	<p>My first encounter with Android development was in this course called Advanced Interaction Design. The course itself was designed for us students to explore ways of communicating with a mobile device. I was in charge of all design decisions and implementations as well as creating the images used in the app. I created the content using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.  </p>
