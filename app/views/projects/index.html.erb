	<h3>Game for iOS (Work in progress)</h3>
	<p>For a project course in school (MAM032: Working Environment, Project) I am developing a game for iOS. I have started learning how to develop using Xcode and Swift, so far I really like it compared to my earlier experiences developing for Android. A first look at the game is shown in the pictures below and a demonstration in the video. I created the content using Illustrator and Photoshop. I am hoping to release the game on App Store quite soon :)</p>

	<h3>Digitalized admission test</h3>
	<p>This is a project ordered from the <%= link_to("Royal College of Music", "http://www.kmh.se/", :class => "bold") %> in Stockholm for our courses in Interaction 1: Neuro modelling, Cognitive Robotics and Agents and Interaction 2: Virtuality and Cognitive Modelling. We were a team of five people looking into how to digitalize an admission test. Difficulties were how to input notes, chords and other music related things without making it too complicated for us to implement. In this project I developed loads of prototypes, made a lot of decisions regarding usability and some front-end programming.</p>

	<h3>Web shop</h3>
	<p>For the course in web security I was the project leader in a project where we were to develop a <u>fictional</u> web shop in php. The main objective was to take in consideration as many security issues as possible while developing the site. We used PHP, Bootstrap, Git and a MySQL database on an Apache server. </p>

	<h3>The selfie app for android</h3>
	<p>My first encounter with Android development was in this course called Advanced Interaction Design. The course itself was designed for us students to explore ways of communicating with a mobile device. I was in charge of all design decisions and implementations as well as creating the images used in the app. I created the content using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.  </p>
