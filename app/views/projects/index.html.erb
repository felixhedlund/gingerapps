	<h3>Admission Test</h3>
	<p>This is an ongoing project ordered from the <%= link_to("Royal College of Music", "http://www.kmh.se/", :class => "bold") %> in Stockholm for our course in Interaction. We are a team of five people looking into how to digitalize an admission test. Difficulties are how to input notes, chords and other music related things without making it too complicated for us to implement. We are currently using the following libraries:  AngularJS, VexFlow, BootStrap, Web MIDI, HTML 5 Audio and SASS.</p>

	<p><%= link_to("Lundakarnevalen", "http://www.lundakarnevalen.se/", :class => "bold") %> is a recurring carneval in Lund produced by students at the university, it is probably the biggest event in Lund. During this project I learned a lot about Ruby on Rails. It was my first project developing for a large scale website. For me this was mostly back-end development which was a good learning experience. My main contribution was in developing a warehouse and order system. Tools used were Ruby on Rails development environment, Twitter Bootstrap for visuals, Heroku for deployment where a Unicorn web server was running and an SQLite database. I have borrowed some of the css used in this project for my own website.</p>
